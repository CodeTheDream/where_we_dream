<p>
  This page will explain the website in general and all the specificities of the features—known as WWD S4 (<strong>S</strong>chools, <strong>S</strong>cholarships, <strong>S</strong>tories, <strong>S</strong>tudents), your ability as a user on the site, and some fun facts. Lets begin with the website.

<%= anchor_tag "Where We Dream?", "wwd", top: false %>

<p>
  Great question! This website is another attempt by <%= link_to "Cruz Núñez", user_path(1) %> to reach equal access to education, especially for undocumented immigrant students. If he can't do it with lobbying, rallies, posters, youth empowerment trainings, newspaper articles, school board support letters, web podcasts, museum spotlight, university CBPR research studies and civil disobedience events, then maybe a website will work. The topic is too big to take on on this one page, so the next best things are this <%= link_to "Ted Talk", "https://youtu.be/dcM0usGVKKI" %> by my friend Eddie, and this <%= link_to "spoken word", "https://youtu.be/5AWbXbYH5hQ" %> by my friend Marco, on IYF's <%= link_to "youtube channel", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtZcHKGd-vUJbKEbN8A8UfA" %>.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Schools?", "schools" %>

<p>
  Another great question! Because not many schools have easy access to information about how they treat undocumented students, forcing students to spend a lot of time researching, and eventually giving up because the situation is too overwhelming. With the Schools feature, students quickly get important information that applies directly to them; information like "Does the school accept undocumented students?" or "Does the school have any merit-based scholarships available for undocumented students?". This is very important information that the students need to know!
</p>

<p>
  You can search through schools by using a keyword seach. Type in "unc" and you will see only UNC schools. Type in the "charlotte" and you will see only schools from the city of Charlotte, NC. Type in "private" and you will see all the private schools on the website.
</p>

<p>
  You can also click on "rank", "name" and "city" at the top of the table in order to sort them. Click once for ascending order, click again for descending.
</p>

<p>
  We are working on adding more schools and information on those schools to the website, so just be patient. Or if you are impatient, reach out and ask to be recruiter, that way you can add the information yourself. Don't be shy. You'll never get anything done by sitting around and doing nothing!
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Schools have ranks?", "ranks" %>

<p>
  Where We Dream hopes to provide undocumented students with a sort of "immigrant-friendly rating" in hopes to better guide students to schools where they might have a chance, and keep them away from wasting time on schools that will ultimately turn them down in the end. Because we are evaluating schools, it makes sense to use the letter-grade system to rank them. We are all familiar with it the system. An "A" is the best you can do, an "F" means the school's pretty bad at giving undocumented students an equal chance at higher education.
</p>

<p>
  Right now the grades are estimates, and most of them are left as "INC", which stands for "incomplete". This means there is not information is available to give the school a score, or not enough thought has gone into giving the school a reasonable score. Soon the grades will be standardized, meaning an "A" will mean that the schools does x, y, and z, while a "B" means the schools only does x, y, but not z, and so on. The information will be posted here on this page, and news about it will be announced through WWD's <%= link_to "Twitter", "https://twitter.com/wherewedreamorg" %> and <%= link_to "Facebook", "https://www.facebook.com/wherewedream" %> pages, so pick one and follow them.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Scholarships?", "scholarships" %>

<p>
  What a great question. The Scholarships feature exists because scholarships for undocumented immigrants are hard to come by. I, Cruz Nunez, remember at one point only having one opportunity at a scholarship. When I didn't win, it felt as if I had no more options. I also remember looking through my high school's scholarships list, and crossing most of them out because I did not qualify, because of a lack of documentation.
</p>

<p>
  Again, you can search using keywords, and sort using the top row of hte table. Scholarships contain a link to the actual website where you can apply from, details about the scholarship, such as the reward amount, the background, the requirements, and the deadline.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Stories?", "stories" %>

<p>
  Yes, because we have so many stories to share; things that we have seen and people need to know about. We have voices, too. I've spoken at many events and I've gotten a lot of comments—from people who didn't know about undocumented students, and they said they understood and thanked me for telling my story. This feature is just another way to do that.
</p>

<p>
  Anyone with an account can write a story. You don't have to be undocumented.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Students?", "students" %>

<p>
  Yes, because it's not just about students searching for opportunities, the opportunities want to search for students, too. This website was made for the students, so we might as well give them a spotlight, too. Some might ask, "but don't you think some students would want their privacy and remain hidden from people?"
</p>

<p>
  They may, and that is why no one is forced to have an account on the website. The studets can remain hidden by simply not having an account here. And if they do create one, they are not forced to write down their location, contact information, biography, or upload a profile picture. They could also create an "Supporter" account. It's up to them really. However, ever since I've embraced who I am, I've been receiving all types of opportunities. I took my curse and turned it into a blessing.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Likes?", "likes" %>

<p>
  Yes. You should be familiar with this one. Facebook, YouTube, iFunny, they all have some sort of liking system. Where We Dream has one, too. You can see them when you visit the schools page. Under the schools' rank, you see the proportion of people who <span style="color: green;">liked</span> and <span class="red">disliked</span> the school. If nobody has given an opinion on the school yet, the likes bar will appear <span class="gray">gray</span>. You can also like scholarships, stories, and comments, but not people.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Wait...comments?", "comments" %>

<p>
  Yes. You should be familiar with this one, too. Facebook, YouTube and iFunny all have some sort of commenting system. Where We Dream has one, too. You can comment on schools, scholarships, stories, and comments, but not people. Yes, you can reply to other people's comments. You're welcome.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Cool, but can I type comments in bold?", "bold" %>

<p>
  Of course you can.
</p>

<p>
  As it turns out, there is this thing called <%= link_to "Markdown", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" %>, a simple way for regular people to write easy-to-read content.
</p>

<%= anchor_tag "Markdown?", "markdown" %>

<p>
  Where We Dream uses Markdown in two ways. The first is in comments. You can use italics, bold, hyperlinks, regular links and ordered lists. Where We Dream calls it simple Markup. I'll show you.
</p>

<p>
  If you write<br/>
  <span class="quotes">
    "*Cruz* **is** [the](https://www.google.com/) best, here is why:<br/><br/>
  </span>
  <span class="quotes">
    1. reasons<br/>
  </span>
  <span class="quotes">
    2. <%= "<http://cruznunez.io/>" %>"
  </span>
</p>

<p>
  You get:
</p>

<p>
  <%= simple_md_parser "*Cruz* **is** [the](https://www.google.com/) best, here is why:\n\n1. reasons\n2. <http://cruznunez.io/>" %>
</p>

<p>
  Easy right?
</p>

<h3>But Cruz, you said there were two Markdowns?</h3>
<%= anchor_tag "But Cruz, you said there were two Markdowns?", "twomarkdowns" %>

<p>
  So you were paying attention I see. Well done. WWD uses Markdown again in the body of stories, and in your biography on your profile page. The difference this time is that you here you can do all the stuff from simple Markdown, but also do headers, unordered lists, images, superscript, highlight, underline, and strikethrough. Check it out.
</p>

<p>
  If you write<br/>
  <span class="quotes">
    "# Biggest
  </span><br/>
  <span class="quotes">
    ## Bigger
  </span><br/>
  <span class="quotes">
